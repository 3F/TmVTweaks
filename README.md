### A true story

*I have a long interesting history, well probably longer than interesting... :)*

I used a very long years the [TightVNC](http://www.tightvnc.com/) for complete remote work with all my different types of home PC (I have many, and several without monitor at all). Then I found [TeamViewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/), that is more convenient for common operations. Good, I thought, and tried to go to the primary use.

But wait, what is it ? what is ... toolbar on the top position ? Why I can't close ? or ok, Why I can't simply move this incredible thing to other position (see below), only minimization and very limited range of moving. Why is so strange o_O ? 

**I can't** use it normally with some applications at all. *Illustration with Firefox:*

I also noticed bug with FullScreen mode, when my mouse is not activated at the top window. *Illustration with Firefox:*

The reason of bug:

Of course I reported about 2 critical (for me) bugs above, before starting of this fixes ! But no action...

`My request is here - 16.03.2016 - Ticket ID: 2404963`

I see only a lot of [new versions](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/download/changelog/) with the same problems and after a few months, still can't see any replies for my request (good job, guys). So, today I released my patches for latest version 11.0.59518 as a lightweight tool. 

My quick implementation was yesterday, and currently we have the following features:

That's all, just a tweaks for TeamViewer software. *Maybe later it will be fixed by company, but today...*
